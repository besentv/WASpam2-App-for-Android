## How to spam with WASpam 2:
Write the **text you want to spam** into **Text to spam**.

Set the amount of messages you want to spam with the **Amount** number picker.

Set the delay between  messages _in milliseconds_ with the **Delay in ms** number picker. This especially depends on your internet speed.

Generally I recommend around 400 milliseconds.
